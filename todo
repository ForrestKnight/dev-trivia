- Make in-game leaderboard rearrange in descending order after each question (highlight current user)
- Figure out why 404 error occurs on refresh in lobby & game in prod
- Allow users to join late
- Create a page containing archived games with questions, players, and results
- Make game start automatically at specific time (right now, I manually start it)
   - And make moveToNextQuestion & moveToReviewPhase work without me (must be implemented at the same time as auto start)
- Considering increasing time per question to 25-30 seconds (will need more data)
